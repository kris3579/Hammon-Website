      As well as being one of the most musically satisfying musicians in the
      area, Gary Hammon is an engaging speaker and story teller. His decades
      of performing with some of the greatest musicians of the 20th C. has
      provided him with a deep fund of anecdotes that are both educating and
      entertaining. Born and raised in Seattle, Mr. Hammon also shares his
      love of the Central District, how it has changed over the years, and

    <p class="quote">I first became aware of Gary Hammon in the Sixties as a serious young
      tenor saxophonist coming out of Garfield High School. After honing his
      craft studying and playing with jazz greats in Boston and New York,
      he's brought a rich heritage and experience back to Seattle.  Today,
      he's sharing the music as a performer and as a teacher to another
      generation.</p>
